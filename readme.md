# `CODO`: `C`ompute `O`perations in `D`ependency `O`rder

`CODO` is an easy-to-use library which abstracts the programming pattern where a set of operations (functions) with the same parameter lists must be computed over the same data, but where some of those operations might depend on other operations' outputs. 

A simple example is computing precision, recall, accuracy, and f1 scores for classification tasks.

All of these can be computed with their own functions that each take two arrays holding the true and predicted class labels, but then we'd be computing `TN`, `FN`, `FP`, and `FN` multiple times over (and we'd even have to re-compute precision and recall to get the f1 score). Alternatively, you could compute all these metrics in the scope of a single function, but for more complex tasks, it's often desirable to isolate this kind of logic into separate functions that each have one job.

`CODO` to the rescue: this library allows you to easily define these operations to isolate their logic with a simple API, automatically figure out the right order to run them, run the "shared" logic only once, and (optionally) parallelize where possible.


## How to use

1. 
    Define the params that each `Operation` will take. **Important:** All `Operation`s you plan to compute in the same `CODO` object must accept the same argument list. We wrap those params with a dataclass to enable full type safety. In our example, we'll define the types for the "true" and "predicted" class labels.

    ```python
    from dataclasses import dataclass

    @dataclass
    class MetricsParams:
        y_true: list[int]
        y_pred: list[int]
    ```

1. 
    Define operations by subclassing `codo.Operation`. The library defines this base class with two generic parameters that specify the input and output types for its `_call()` method, respectively (see code comments for details).

    Subclasses must override the `_call()` method, and may set a list of its `dependencies` as a class variable.

    The `_call()` method takes two parameters:

    - `acc`: A `codo.Accumulator[ParamsT]` object, where `ParamsT` is a generic variable that in our case represents our `MetricsParams` dataclass. Essentially this is a glorified `dict` providing full type safety that stores the result of operations computed earlier in the dependency tree. You can access those results by keying into `acc` with the operation's class.
    - `params`: An instance of the `MetricsParams` dataclass we defined above.

    <br />

    ```python
    from codo import Operation
    from typing import override


    # When we subclass `Operation[MetricsParams, int]` below, the generics
    # are providing a shorthand for the following signature for the `_call()` method:
    #
    #     def _call(
    #         self,
    #         acc: codo.Accumulator[MetricsParams], 
    #         params: MetricsParams
    #     ) -> int:
    #         ...
    #
    # The first generic param sets the type for `params`,
    # and the second sets the method's return type.
    class TruePositives(Operation[MetricsParams, int]):
        @override
        def _call(self, acc, params):
            return sum(t == 1 and p == 1 for t, p in zip(true, pred))


    class FalsePositives(Operation[MetricsParams, int]):
        @override
        def _call(self, acc, params):
            return sum(t == 0 and p == 1 for t, p in zip(true, pred))


    class Precision(Operation[MetricsParams, float]):
        dependencies = [TruePositives, FalsePositives]

        @override
        def _call(self, acc, params):
            tp = acc[TruePositives]
            fp = acc[FalsePositives]
            # ^ Both resolve to `int` types here thanks to
            # generics on TruePositives/FalsePositives!

            return tp / (tp + fp)
    ```

1. 
    Create a `CODO` object with your `Operation`s, then call it like a function to get the outputs. 

    You may need to define `Operation`s for intermediate steps where you don't actually care about the output—in this case, you can set `silent=True` for that operation. This includes them in the dependency graph, but discards their output in the final returned dict unless `with_silents=True`.

    ```python
    from codo import CODO

    codo = CODO([
        Precision(),
        TruePositives(silent=True),
        FalsePositives(silent=True),
    ])
    # ^ Order doesn't matter in this list, Operations
    # will be computed in a valid dependency order.

    codo(
        MetricsParams(
            y_true=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
            y_pred=[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
        ),
        # with_silents=True
    )

    # {<class '__main__.Precision'>: 0.75}
    ```
